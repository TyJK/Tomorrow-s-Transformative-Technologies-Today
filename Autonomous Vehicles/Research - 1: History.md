# History of Autnomous Vehicles 

An autonomous car also known as a driverless car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017 automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who is ready at a moment's notice to take control of the vehicle.

Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. 

## Autonomous vs. automated
Autonomous means having the power for self-governance

SAE automated vehicle classifications:

- Level 0: Automated system issues warnings but has no vehicle control.
- Level 1 (”hands on”):
- Level 2 (”hands off”): 
- Level 3 (”eyes off”):
- Level 4 (”mind off”):
- Level 5 (”wheel optional”): No human intervention is required. An example would be a robot taxi.

Experiments have been conducted on automating cars since at least the 1920s; promising trials took place in the 1950s and work has proceeded since then. The first self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s
