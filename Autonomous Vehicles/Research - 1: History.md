# History of Autonomous Vehicles 

An autonomous car also known as a driverless car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017 automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who is ready at a moment's notice to take control of the vehicle.

Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. 

## Autonomous vs. automated
Autonomous means having the power for self-governance

SAE automated vehicle classifications:

- Level 0: Automated system issues warnings but has no vehicle control.
- Level 1 (”hands on”):Driver and automated system shares control over the vehicle. An example would be Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed, or Parking Assistance, which is the opposite. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. 
- Level 2 (”hands off”): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and steering), but the driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to immediately intervene. 
- Level 3 (”eyes off”): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, but the driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so.
- Level 4 (”mind off”):  As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, i.e. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self driving is supported only in limited areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, i.e. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.
- Level 5 (”wheel optional”): No human intervention is ever required. An example would be a robot taxi.

Experiments have been conducted on automating cars since at least the 1920s; promising trials took place in the 1950s and work has proceeded since then. The first self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, however 

- The first competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge was held on March 13, 2004 in the Mojave Desert.
- 2009 The Google Self-Driving Car project begins
- 2015 Tesla release its Autopilot software update.
- 2016 Uber releases self driving taxies (Level 3 - 4) in San Francisco
