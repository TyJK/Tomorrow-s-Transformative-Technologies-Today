# The Current State of the Art of Autnomous Vehicles 

Today, many different companies including Google, Facebook, Uber, Udacity and Nutonomy, are not just experimenting with this technology on closed courses, but are bringing it into the real world. Tesla's Model 3 is able to match traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when your destination is near and self-park when near a parking spot. Elon Musk as stated, and there does not seem to be any reason to doubt, that Tesla models on the road right now are capable of eventualy achieving full autonomy. "Robot Taxis" are becomming common and the law is attempting to keep out of the way of progress. In many states and provinces, autonomous vehicles are perfectly legal, with some restrictions of course. Cars are also now upgradeable via software updates, and this is already having a positive impact. In one case where a Tesla was driven off a cliff (the driver was in control), the occupants sustained only minor injuries after plunging 300 feet, and the next month an update was released that would have likely prevented the accident in the first place. These changes are small and creeping, but soon they will transform the world into something we don't recognize.
