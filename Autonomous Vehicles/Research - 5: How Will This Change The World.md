# How Will Autonomous Vehicles Change Our World? 

### The Transportation Industry 

It's going to disappear as a job sector, almost entirely. There will be transportation engineers and other jobs related to the problems of transportation, but much of the work in the industry, which comprises some [4.6 million jobs](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm) in the US (~3% of jobs), will disappear almost completely. This is one of the more inevidtable changes, as once the technology is widely available, there are almost no downsides to using an auto over a human. They do not sleep or eat or demand pay raises. This will be one of the first industries to be upended by the next generation of technology. It won't happen overnight, but it might be sooner than you think.

### Cars and our relationship with them 

What if you didn't need to own a car, or what if your car MADE you money. With autonmous vehicles, why would your car ever be parked? You could take it to work, and home and call it when you needed it, but it could in the mean time [go out and drive people around for a fare](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reveals-tesla-shared-fleet-2016-7) that goes to you. It might not pay for itself, but it would certainly be better than it wasting space on the driveway. This could theoretically drastically reduce the number of cars needed period, and reduce the need to own a car at all. Half of the environmental cost of a car comes from its manufacturer, but if we set it up properly, we might be able to have large swaths of the population go without owning a car at all. We might also reduce the amount of land we need to dedicate to parking lots, because cars would not be parked a lot. They would be on the move helping others. 

### Our kid's won't understand what a traffic jam is

This land use reduction might also happen with highways. Right now, money is poured into expanding highways to reduce traffic, and this doesn't even really work as larger highways become proportionally more popular. But what DOES help is having drivers who don't make many mistakes. Who don't take 3 second to start accelerating or randomly breke because the car ahead flashed THEIR break lights. This will mean not only can we do productive things in the car, but we can spend less time in the car in the first place. Traffic jams will become far less common and whatever (hopefully minimal) emissions cars still produce at this point will plummet further.
