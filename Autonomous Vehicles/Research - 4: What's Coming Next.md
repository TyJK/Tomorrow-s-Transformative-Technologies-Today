# What's Coming Next for Autonomous Vehicles 

What comes next is basically just improvements and wide spread adoption. As autonomous cars become more common, we will start to see them linked up to each other, so your car won't just know what's around it, it will know what's around every car nearby. This will allow cars to learn from each other and provide unprecedented amounts of data and experience. 

### What are some of the benifits?

We are going to see a massive decrease in automobile deaths, both from increased safety features of the cars themselves, and more importantly from the fact that cars will be smart, partially self-governing and self-organizing, and hyper-aware of their surroundings. We will have systems in place rapidly that make it unnecessary for the disabled or the elderly to have a license in order to own a vehicle, as they will never need to guide it. We will see a major increase in the autonomy of these populations as the autonomy of our vehicles increases.

### What are some of the potential dangers?

We will need to keep in mind however that increased interconnectedness leads to an increased potential for abuse. If security isn't a major priority, hacking could very quickly go from endangering your bank account or data to endangering the lives of thousnads of people. There are also other ways that autonomous vehicles could be used for terroristic acts, such as using them as ordanence delivery systems. Lastly, while the technology is improving all the time, humans still write software, and there will be bugs. These bugs will have leathal consequences, but they will likely not be as severe as the collisions caused by humans. On a more technical level, it can be difficult to impossible to prove that an algorithm is doing what you want. It might act and behave properly, but you don't know that it's reacting for the reasons it should be until you find the exception and an accident occures. This difficulty in verifying the safety of an algorithm is a vital problem that must be overcome.
